# Inline Toggle Notes

This plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) allows you to create inline toggle sections within your notes.    
When a toggle is clicked, it dynamically loads and renders the content of a linked note, providing a clean way to embed and expand information directly within your current view.
