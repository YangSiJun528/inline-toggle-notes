# Inline Toggle Notes

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) allows you to create inline toggle sections within your notes.    
When a toggle is clicked, it dynamically loads and renders the content of a linked note, providing a clean way to expand information directly within your current view.

## Usage

To create an inline toggle, simply create an internal link to another note within your Obsidian vault. The plugin will automatically convert it into a toggle.
